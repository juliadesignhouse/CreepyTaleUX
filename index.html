        <h1>Welcome to Creepy Tale on iPhone!</h1>
        <p>This guide takes you through the design rationale, focusing on the new UI elements crafted for various game systems adapted from the original PC version. Youâ€™ll also get a chance to explore the design and interact with the prototype. Enjoy the journey!</p>
        <h1>Gesture & Area in Screen</h1>
        <p>The non-user research highlights that using the number of fingers is crucial to deciding on the gaming experience in a mobile game.</p>
        <p>Using one or two fingers on each hand is ideal for effective accessibility and engagement when playing a mobile game. While single-finger gestures are recommended for ease of execution.</p>
        <img src="pictures/1.png" alt="The Gamer Stance">
        <p>For the iPhone version of Creepy Tale, this translates to using one-finger mechanics for every system and interaction with the game, optimizing simplicity and reducing player frustration.</p>
        <p>The gamer stance is a control style where players hold the device with both hands and use their thumbs for input, providing intuitive and precise control for actions and traversal.</p>
        <img src="pictures/2.png" alt="Accessibility Zones">
        <h2>Control Design</h2>
        <p>The control design will mainly focus on the traversal system, inventory system, map, and different interactive actions:</p>
        <h3>Left Thumb Control:</h3>
        <p>Traversal System:</p>
        <p>Movement: A control scheme is positioned on the left bottom of the screen, aligning with gaming controllers. This control allows characters to move left and right.</p>
        <p>Jump: The jump button is placed at the top of the movement but still within the easy accessible zone.</p>
        <img src="pictures/3.png" alt="Left Thumb Control">
        <img src="pictures/4.png" alt="Jump Button">
        <h3>Right Thumb Control:</h3>
        <p>Inventory: An inventory placed at the bottom right, with a collapsible menu that players can expand when tapping on the inventory.</p>
        <p>Map: Specifically designed for the mobile version, the map allows players to toggle between a single-room view and a multi-room view, enabling seamless switching between a compact and expanded layout.</p>

        <h3>Actions:</h3>
        <p>Five gestures are primarily used in 1TG games: drag, hold, slide, swipe, and tap.</p>
        <ul>These gestures are linked to two types of actions:
        <li>Controlled Actions: Require continuous interaction (e.g., dragging to draw or holding to steer).</li>
        <li>Initiated Actions: Triggered by a single input and execute automatically or instantly (e.g., tapping to attack or swiping to move).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tap: Use: Interacting with objects or performing actions. For instance:</p>
        <p>Tapping to pick up an item.</p>
        <p>Tapping on a door to open or close it.</p>
        <p>Tapping to activate a hidden mechanism, there will be an icon to remind the user to intuitively guide the user tap on it.</p>
